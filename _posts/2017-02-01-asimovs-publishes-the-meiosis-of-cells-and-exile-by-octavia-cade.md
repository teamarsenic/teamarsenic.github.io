> For Lina, exile began not at the gates of Dzhambul, at the place she was sent for her sentence: a distant place and sad, far from science. Instead, her exile came in the small space between trains and trials, in a dark cell, and cramped. That was what exile meant to her: small spaces and the echo of gunshots, the splitting of cells and selves.
