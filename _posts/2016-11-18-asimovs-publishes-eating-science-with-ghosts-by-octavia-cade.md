> I’m a little bit drunk before the meal even starts. My guests are late, so that’s some excuse—and a bad joke to boot—but it’s always been easier to see the ghosts when I’m not entirely sober.

“Eating Science with Ghosts” is now available at [Asimov’s](http://www.asimovs.com/). Feel free to send comments to Octavia [via Twitter](http://twitter.com/OJCade).
