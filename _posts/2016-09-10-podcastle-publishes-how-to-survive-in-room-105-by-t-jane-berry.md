> Principal Freezarro announced that you’re substitute teaching in my kindergarten class for the next few weeks. I’m so excited! I’ve seen your work with the Vindicators, and just to let you know, I think it’s ridiculous that you were sentenced to six months of community service over the bridge incident. Who expects you to save the city from an army of wood chipper-earthworm hybrids and not take out a few historic landmarks? As we say in room 105, “You get what you get and you don’t get upset.” And please, please don’t let them get upset.

“How to Survive in Room 105” is now [free to read online at PodCastle](http://podcastle.org/story-texts/how-to-survive-in-room-105-by-t-jane-berry/); a podcast narrated by Jen R. Albert [is also available](http://podcastle.org/2016/09/09/podcastle-miniature-90-how-to-survive-in-room-105/). Feel free to send comments to Jane [via Twitter](http://twitter.com/TJaneBerry).
