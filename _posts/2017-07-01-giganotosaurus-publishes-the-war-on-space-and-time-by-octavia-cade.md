> Helen woke to a room grown smaller than before. It was no illusion, no result of short sleep and poor light, a head grown soft and malleable under code. Her knees knew before her brain. They barked up against the bed that lay beside her own, the iron of its railings, the thin mattress and the covers all smoothed over.

“The War on Space and Time” is now free to read online in [Giganotosaurus](http://giganotosaurus.org/2017/07/01/the-war-on-space-and-time/). Feel free to send comments to Octavia [via Twitter](http://twitter.com/ojcade).
