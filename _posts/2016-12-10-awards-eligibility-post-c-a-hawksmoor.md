I wasn’t planning on making one of these: I’ve only had the one short story out this year, and I don’t keep a blog where I could post about things like this. However, after a little gentle encouragement from one of my beautiful Clarion siblings, here we go.

My only awards eligible story for 2016 is:

“[The Stone Garden](http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/the-stone-garden/)” (*Beneath Ceaseless Skies*, March 2016)  
About war, healing, and growing blooms of stone.  
Eligible in the short story category for the Nebula, Hugo, and World Fantasy awards.

More to come in 2017!
